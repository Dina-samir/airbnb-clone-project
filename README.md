## üõ†Ô∏è Features Overview

1.  **API Documentation**
    * **OpenAPI Standard:** The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration for consumers.
    * **Django REST Framework:** Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user and property data.
    * **GraphQL:** Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need.

2.  **User Authentication**
    * **Endpoints:** `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`
    * **Features:** Enables users to register new accounts, authenticate (login), and manage their personal profiles. This secures access to personalized functionalities.

3.  **Property Management**
    * **Endpoints:** `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`
    * **Features:** Allows hosts to create new property listings, update existing details, retrieve property information for display, and delete listings.

4.  **Booking System**
    * **Endpoints:** `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`
    * **Features:** Facilitates the process for users to make new bookings, update booking details (e.g., dates if allowed), and manage existing reservations, including check-in and check-out information.

5.  **Payment Processing**
    * **Endpoints:** `/payments/`
    * **Features:** Handles the transactional aspects related to bookings, processing payments, and recording payment details for financial reconciliation.

6.  **Review System**
    * **Endpoints:** `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`
    * **Features:** Provides functionality for users to post new reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in, as well as manage their own reviews.

7.  **Database Optimizations**
    * **Indexing:** Implements database indexes on frequently accessed columns to significantly speed up data retrieval operations.
    * **Caching:** Utilizes caching strategies to store frequently requested data in memory (e.g., Redis), reducing the load on the database and improving application performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

The following technologies constitute the core of the AirBnB Clone project's backend system:

* **Django:** A high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It will be used for building the robust backend RESTful API.
* **Django REST Framework:** A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs on top of Django. It simplifies the creation of serializable representations for models and provides a browsable API.
* **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system renowned for its reliability, feature set, and performance. It will serve as the primary data store for all project entities.
* **GraphQL:** A query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. It enables clients to request exactly what they need.
* **Celery:** A distributed task queue that will be used for handling asynchronous tasks, such as sending email notifications, processing payments, or generating reports in the background, without blocking the main application flow.
* **Redis:** An in-memory data structure store, used as a message broker for Celery and for implementing high-performance caching and session management to reduce database load and speed up responses.
* **Docker:** A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies into isolated containers. This ensures consistent development, testing, and production environments, simplifying deployment and scaling.
* **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions) for continuous integration and continuous delivery. They automate the processes of building, testing, and deploying code changes, ensuring higher code quality and faster release cycles.

## üë• Team Roles

To successfully execute this project, various roles will be essential, each with distinct responsibilities:

* **Backend Developer:** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, designing and implementing database schemas, writing business logic, and ensuring the overall performance and scalability of the backend system.
* **Database Administrator (DBA):** Manages database design, implements indexing strategies for performance optimization, handles data migrations, ensures data integrity, and oversees database security and backups.
* **DevOps Engineer:** Focuses on setting up and maintaining the development, testing, and production infrastructure. This includes implementing CI/CD pipelines, managing containerization (Docker), monitoring application health, and automating deployment processes.
* **QA Engineer:** Designs and executes test plans and test cases (both manual and automated) to ensure that all backend functionalities meet the specified requirements, are free of bugs, and adhere to quality standards.

## üìà API Documentation Overview

* **REST API:** Detailed documentation will be available through the OpenAPI standard (formerly Swagger). This will include comprehensive descriptions of endpoints for users, properties, bookings, and payments, along with request/response schemas.
* **GraphQL API:** The GraphQL schema itself acts as documentation, providing a clear contract for the available data and operations. Tools like GraphiQL can be used for interactive exploration.
